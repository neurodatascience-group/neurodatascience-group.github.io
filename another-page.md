## A big wide world...  

We hope for this site to serve as a useful reference. For example, here is a list of commonly used open data repositories in neuroscience and beyond. 

| Repository        | Description        | Citation | Discipline |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:------|
| CRCNS           | A result of a NSF/NIH sponsored collaborative research program, CRCNS is a public archive that shares experimental neuroscience data. | Teeters et al., 2008  | Neuroscience      |
| DANDI | The DANDI archive is a cloud-based repository for sharing and publishing electrophysiology data, including cellular and systems-level recordings. It aims to standardize data sharing and analysis, enabling researchers to easily access, contribute, and reuse complex neurophysiology datasets. | Gosh et al., 2023  |   Neuroscience    |
| NeMO           | The NeMO repository is the access point for genomic data from brain-related research projects. Serving as the primary repository the BRAIN initiative, in addition to a web portal providing searchable access to raw data, the NeMO Archive provides a number of tools: including a direct interface between data and cloud-computing resources, as well as a visualization and analysis platform for the data.     | https://nemoarchive.org   | Neuroscience | 
| OpenNeuro           | OpenNeuro is a free and open platform for sharing MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and other neuroimaging datasets, organized according to the BIDS standard. It promotes open science by enabling researchers to easily publish and access neuroimaging data for collaborative research and analysis. | Markiewicz et al., 2021  | Neuroscience |
| DABI  | DABI is a data repository and portal for projects that collect human and animal intracranial recordings. Serving as a main repository for BRAIN Initiative data, it allows users to search, visualize, and analyze multimodal data from these projects. The data providers maintain full control of data sharing privileges and can organize and manage their data with a user-friendly and intuitive interface. | Ducan et al., 2023 | Neuroscience |
| EBRAINS| EBRAINS provides access to a free and open database of neuroscience data, computational models and software. | https://www.ebrains.eu | Neuroscience |
| Dryad| Dryad is a data publishing platform committed to the open availability and routine re-use of research data. Dryad curates all data and metadata and publishes exclusively under a Creative Commons Public Domain License.| https://datadryad.org/ | Multiple |
| Zenodo| Designed by researchers from the CERN data center, Zenodo’s original aim was for the long term preservation of digital objects for high-energy physics. Zenodo has since expanded into data storage for a number of disciplines. | https://zenodo.org/ | Multiple |
| Figshare| Figshare is a freely available data publishing platform where researchers can share and receive credit for multiple types of scholarly output. Support for larger datasets is also being incorporated.| https://figshare.com/ | Multiple |
| OSF | OSF is a free and open-source project management tool that supports researchers throughout their entire project lifecycle in open science best practices. In addition to manuscript hosting, OSF provides tools to host code and data as well. | https://osf.io/ | Multiple |
| Vivli | Vivli has developed a global data sharing and analytics platform. With a focus on sharing individual participant-level data from completed clinical trials, the non-profit aims to broadly serve the international research community. | https://vivli.org/ | Multiple |
