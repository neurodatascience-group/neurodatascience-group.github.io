## In a nutshell
The study of the brain is a compelling example of the power of convergent science. Over the last few decades, advances in neuroscience techniques and experimentation, as well as in data science tools to analyze the resulting data, have dramatically furthered our understanding of fundamental brain functions. Historically, it has been common for analytical approaches to have a considerable lag in development following the availability of new neuroscience techniques. However, this relationship has not simply been unidirectional as there have been examples in which analytical developments have directly led to new scientific questions and experiments. Here, we promote the advancement of research at the intersection of neuroscience and data science, which we call neurodatascience, towards a sustainable future.
