| CRCNS           | A result of a NSF/NIH sponsored collaborative research program, CRCNS is a public archive that shares experimental neuroscience data. | Teeters et al., 2008  | Neuroscience      |
| DANDI | The DANDI archive is a cloud-based repository for sharing and publishing electrophysiology data, including cellular and systems-level recordings. It aims to standardize data sharing and analysis, enabling researchers to easily access, contribute, and reuse complex neurophysiology datasets. | Gosh et al., 2023  |   Neuroscience    |
| NeMO           | The NeMO repository is the access point for genomic data from brain-related research projects. Serving as the primary repository the BRAIN initiative, in addition to a web portal providing searchable access to raw data, the NeMO Archive provides a number of tools: including a direct interface between data and cloud-computing resources, as well as a visualization and analysis platform for the data.     | https://nemoarchive.org   | Neuroscience | 
| OpenNeuro           | OpenNeuro is a free and open platform for sharing MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and other neuroimaging datasets, organized according to the BIDS standard. It promotes open science by enabling researchers to easily publish and access neuroimaging data for collaborative research and analysis. | Markiewicz et al., 2021  | Neuroscience |



DABI
DABI is a data repository and portal for projects that collect human and animal intracranial recordings. Serving as a main repository for BRAIN Initiative data, it allows users to search, visualize, and analyze multimodal data from these projects. The data providers maintain full control of data sharing privileges and can organize and manage their data with a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
